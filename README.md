# Elm Reboot Demo

This demo shows how to “kill” an Elm app, and then restart it from where it was, without losing any state or DOM state, or causing any errors to be thrown in the console.

How to run:

1. Clone this repo.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Open the link that is printed.

Note: This demo uses elm-watch for convenience while hacking on it, but elm-watch has nothing to do with the actual rebooting.
